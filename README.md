# Web-Scraper
My school project which was coded in Python using pandas, to scrape information from a website and display it in various ways and explaining the information breifly.

This built on my skills in Python, Pandas and Seaborn to manipulate data and display it in a way that other people can ciew and look at to better compare and use to solve real world problems.
